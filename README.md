# model-creator-app
React Native app for the Model Creator system. This was first developed as a senior project at Calvin College. It's a developer tool right now, not a product, so keep that in mind. If you would like to see the web component, go here: https://github.com/JesseKuntz/model-creator-web

## Dependencies
* Git (but hopefully you have that already): https://git-scm.com/
* Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
* Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
* On your mobile device, install Expo. It's the app you will be running Model Creator within.

## Get Started
NOTE: There are a lot of ways to develop apps, and a lot of ways to develop apps with Expo (the tool I used).
I developed mine for an iPhone 7, but Expo is a toolchain built around React Native so the app will work for both
iPhone and Android. Either way, this is just one way to get it set up - not necessarily the "right" way, if there is one.
